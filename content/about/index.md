I'm Odhy Pradhana, an accountant and Python developer based in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.

I work full-time as an accountant, but I spend much of my free time building with Python. What started as a hobby turned into a way to automate repetitive tasks, explore ideas, and build useful tools.

I focus on creating helper scripts, streamlining workflows, and developing simple websites with a clear purpose. I enjoy building things that are straightforward, easy to use, and well-documented, both for others and for myself.

## Writing

I write to share what I’ve learned and what I’m building, like working on a project with the garage door open. It helps me trace where I’ve been and how I got here. It’s part reference, part reflection. Most of my writing falls into two areas:

- **[Writings](/writings)**, where I publish guides and how-to articles based on my experience.
- **[Notes](/notes)**, where I collect short, technical references like cheatsheets.

There’s no schedule. I write when something clicks or when I need to remember how I got through a challenge. Topics often revolve around Python, Hugo, and automation. I use Giscus for comments, and I’m always open to feedback, discussion, or ideas.

## Away From the Screen

I enjoy quiet walks in nature, visiting beaches, and spending time with my wife and two cats. I also play guitar and piano.
